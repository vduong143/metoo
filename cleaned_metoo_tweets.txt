apparently you had issues back then god may forgive you but once a person is abused its a part of their memory for live. you caused shame & pain in their lives. denial is part of your disease & blaming others shoes guilt.  metoo
this reminds me of a wolf in sheeps clothing. stop blaming others for your actions. you have shamed these females & abused them. i suggest you get this one honestly right with god & stop living in denial. metoo
metoo the abuser always starts blaming along with denial. youve chosen both. democrats have nothing to do with the truth coming out. shame on you for making these girls live with their shame all these years and for horrific emotional stress its caused them.

the greatest thing i have learned through my own metoo struggles is that no one in a just society gets overlooked. the days of a selfish individualistic societal norm need to end. fortunately as new generations come of age we can change the "norm".
for speaking out for men that have been sexually abused. metoo it is time in our society that we stop allowing an atmosphere of silence where victims feel ashamed for being victims.
uh oh! they done woke up with metoo movement. mamma o wont play. she and the other strong women are gong to lead the way to change the atmosphere in hollywood hopefully resonating in society so we victims dont have to suffer for years being ashamed of being victims.

what i learned backing female founders: every one has a metoo story -
as metoo has been very triggering remember help is available 1 800 273 8255. its ok not to be ok.
that said being a survivor of metoo does not grant you a pass to abuse others or stay complicit in the abuse of others. work on your shit.
if feminism is truly about equality then metoo must be inclusive of all voices of those who experience sexual harassment assault and rape.
that said forgive me if see dont take your faux outrage over metoo seriously. just calling out bullshit as i see it. where is my apology?
metoo is no shock to those of us who experience this crap on a daily basis. it will never end until we all take responsibility for our role

and of course men have to jump right into the metoo convo bc male privileges. shut up. listen to us. believe us. its not abt you.
