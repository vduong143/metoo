my first boyfriend wanted me to give him a blowjob
he grabbed my head pushed me down and held my head there
i was 19

my sister’s husband started playing a game by chasing me around the house
it always ended with his finger inside me
i was 15

my sister’s husband put his hand in my underwear because he thought my butt was sexy
i was 12

i was pushed up against a ladder and forcefully kissed while at work
i was 19

even sexual harassment is wrong
my first time was at 12 years old and i will never forget the shame
it continues to today

the hotel then accused me of being a prostitute, which made me feel almost more violated
some years ago i was raped in my room by a hotel employee at the prestigious camino real hotel  mexico city

my trust hasn't recovere
that was my third
my last
big factor in leaving a career i enjoyed

my first #metoo happened when i was 7 
i wasn't believed and it set me up for future problems

a man has randomly pulled out his dick in front of me with zero warning
i don't know why this is a thing
i generally avoid situations where "what the fuck' is the reaction to my genitals

i was a state senator and this damn political hack and lobbyists would corner me and grab my breast
doesn’t matter who or what you are

he was a family friend type person
my friend had gone off to swim
i had my period so sat on the couch alone
that's when he did it

i was 14
it was a married man who looked 50+
his hands trailed over my clothed child body
he laughed at my discomfort

walking along the street in bangkok with then boyfriend
guy on motorbike drives past and grabs my breast

i had tape to use if he ever bothered me again & he dropped out of program before end of year
thought about reporting him to police  but chose instead to tell every female grad student in my department about his behavior
took tape out of machine  double bagged it stuffed it in a box in back of closet 
wanted to save as evidence if i needed it
a grad student in my department pissed that i would not date him left an obscene sickening message on my voicemail

i was 13
seethed with rage for years
he was small
i was tall  strong an athlete
i froze from shock  but i could have pounded him

when i was 14 years old my stepfather drew me to him his legs spread and rubbed me against him 
i can still smell the booze
always thought it was my fault
i’m 73

he was my friend
best friend of my 1st love
i trusted him
he was driving me home
knew him for years
he raped me
never reported

another time i was told by the owner to go to the lady rest room  which he came in behind me  cornered me and tried to kiss me

i have several stories to tell from jobs through out my life
once i hid in the ladies bathroom of the building because i was terrified
i have been sexually harassed through out my life on several jobs
but for the sake of having a job i had to deal with it

i didn't "let it" happen
abusers  like rapists  hurt us without our consent
we need to stop blaming victims and start helping them
as a survivor of abuse  sexual assault and sexual harassment i know the shame that keeps you silent

i remembered the first time i experienced this
i expected “no” to be respected  but my voice was ignored
it was terrifying.

in my freshman english class a gay teaching assistant made me uncomfortable and apprehensive
i can just barely imagine how women must feel

my first year in college i would receive unwelcome solicitations from gay men who didn’t know anything more about me than my looks

the boy who broke into my parent's house and got in bed with me while i was sleeping because i flirted at a party

in colleges I  worked at a pizza place
I was making orders for a boss once
he asked what i would do if he asked me out or touched me

hated my body for decades because of the attacks
caused many nightmares
had to learn to forgive myself for not fighting back harder

i was 32 
man sat next to me gave me creeps when i stood he grabbed my ass
i kicked him back 2 seats

i was stalked by a cop when i was a senior in high school and when i told adults they brushed it off—because “cops are good guys.”


i can't say i understand why some men feel the need to masturbate in front of women without consent
i can say it has happened to me more than once

i was a teen
i said i didn't want to see his penis
he didn't care
he kept pulling it out  masturbating in front of me


the abuse was rampant in our dept too
and as a grad student the professors used their power to prey
i was not believed or told not to say anything and once i did speak up was blamed and shamed by women as much as by men
but i'll never be silenced again in solidarity

i was forcibly molested by my dad's business partner when i was 8 
I was date-raped/lost my virginity at 15  
I was sexually assaulted by a professor in grad school and sexually harassed by countless other professors

time to start addressing sexual harassment and assault in higher education
this includes graduate school and professors who use status and tenure to hide their predator ways

a family friend when i was 9 was dancing with me very provocatively and tried to kiss me in the mouth he was an elderly man

my babysitter when i was 7 was a female and she violated me.
my pediatrician doctor choo squeezed my butt telling me i'm getting "thick"

i was 11 at school in bethesda md
dressed nicely
a boy put a fudgesicle between my legs on stockings to make it look like blood

i spent 6 months in an abusive relationship
in that 6 month period i was mentally, physically, sexually, verbally, and spiritually abused
i still suffer to this day 
some days i feel bad for my boyfriend because i’ll whack out in him just because of his gender

4 through 8 aunt's husband and again at 18
a man i didn't know i was pregnant attacked me
then again at 24 husband who didn't want to take no 
he never did and again at 25 a business associate i was pregnant

when i threatened to go public he told me to think of his wife and daughter
he was my high school activities director

when i was in jhs my science teacher gave me a ring like one for my finger
he used to check each day to see that i was wearing it

should i name 2 bosses who raped me?
should i name the cornell professor who raped me?
should i name the women i told who ignored me?

i was 9
he was my uncle

1st time
i was 16 yrs old
jerk even bragged about it when he signed my year book
nothing happened.
too many

the first time i recall is being 17 and having the bus owner massage my shoulders whilst recalling a dream about “us” in the shower.

when you make sure the guy you are going out with knows you aren’t sleeping with him so he snaps your bra open

i can still see the predatory look on his face when he groped me
pretty sure i've hated my body ever since
2nd time was comment from another 2 yrs later about my bikini
never wore one again
there are more but 280 character is not enough

all i can say is # metoo at too young of an age that now i struggle in my adult life trusting what"good" intentions others have.

i thought a lot about whether i should post this and about the implications why should i feel embarrassed about this. i shouldn't.

#metoo can cause life long issues to handle and change

i was raped by my pastor

he was in my living room
the male cop asked me 9 times if it was my husband
the female cop asked why i didn’t defend myself

the first time i was 5 and he was arrested within an hour
that was 50 years ago

i’m not ready to share these stories yet
i may never be
but #metoo

i was sexually assaulted by two chp officers during a late night traffic stop
i was 18

i said no
he said "stop being such a baby"
got fired from a job two weeks after reporting sexual harassment by their golden boy

ran into him yesterday at my college reunion
he was hanging out with my friends
#metoo

i had a boss who told me in my yearly review that i should really wear shorter skirts more often #metoo

when my parents divorced a new man came into her life
he came into my bedroom and put his hand under my gown
i was 8yrs old #metoo
