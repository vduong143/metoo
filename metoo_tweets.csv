KHGlasgow,,ever notice that when survivors of sexual assault and harassment speak up  their stories never waver  and yet sexual predators' stories constantly shift and change? # metoo
KHGlasgow,,thank you for getting it! it is infuriating  but it won't stop me from trying to change the status quo. for example  after the lawsuit  the school made significant changes to title ix. i'm using my rage to make change so women never have to go through this again. # metoo
KHGlasgow,,the abuse was rampant in our dept. too. and  as a grad  student  the profs used their power to prey. i was not believed or told not to say anything  and  once i did speak up  was blamed and shamed by women as much as by men. but i'll never be silenced again. in solidarity! # metoo
KHGlasgow,,i’m so sorry to hear this. not only is it full of sexual predators  but those who watch and stay silent are equal in numbers. the time is finally here when i think people are going to listen. at least i’m going to do all i can ! # metoo # sexualpredators

KHGlasgow,,and 50+ women accused cosby  16+ women accused trump  dc is plagued with sexual assault  as is academia  silicon valley  etc.  and the beat goes on. when will women be believed - whether it is one woman or a hundred speaking up? # metoo
KHGlasgow,,i believe you  and i'm so sorry you had to go through this. i was forcibly molested by my dad's biz partner when i was 8  was date-raped/lost my virginity at 15  was sexually assaulted by a professor in grad school  and sexually harassed by countless other profs. # metoo
KHGlasgow,,time to start addressing sexual harassment and assault in higher education. this includes graduate school and professors who use status and tenure to hide their predator ways. # metoo
KHGlasgow,,this year's oscars should nominate only women in every category  as well as hire only women to host  director  produce  crew  stage  light  cater  etc. it would send a powerful and very public message that sexual assault and harassment will no longer be tolerated. # metoo
KHGlasgow,,the victims didn’t know each other  span different age groups  have different careers  and yet they all had similar stories. liars! # metoo
KHGlasgow,,jane fonda is absolutely correct. and i say this as a white woman who was sexually assaulted and harassed. women of color need to be recognized and heard! # metoo
KHGlasgow,,that was awesome! any chance you’d want to help tackle sexual assault and harassment by tenured professors in academia? too little coverage. # metoo

TXmoonspeak,,do you hear that? it's the sound of our sisters resisting with blood  sweat & tears with voices raised crossing the chasm of what came before with the radical idea of equality of empowerment of speaking truth and being believed # metoo @ debramessing @ rosie
TXmoonspeak,,as a survivor of sexual assault  whenever someone states that they still like a man in spite of revelations of his sexual predator ways - it feels like a cheese grater dragged across my brain  my heart  each flesh-covered bump of my spine. # metoo

TXmoonspeak,,@ debramessing is soliciting # metoo stories. i shared about the 1st time a man masturbated in front of me against my will. as a writer  i know that sharing our stories is an act of courage: today i learned that asking for stories is akin to bestowing empowerment. # raiseyourvoicehttps://twitter.com/txmoonspeak/status/928741665849905152 …

TXmoonspeak,,yes  for me as well. it's heartening to know that more sexual predators are being called out for their crimes  but it's heartbreaking for survivors to revisit old wounds  to have them reopened  in the process of these ongoing revelations. stay strong. # metoo

JohnnyAkzam,,i'm a bigger feminist than most women i meet. and yes i have a right to use the # metoo hashtag. it's not just for display and frivolous use.
JohnnyAkzam,,well there ya go...you just showed that the kind of thinking you promote is divisive. you know why? # metoo it's not just about women.
JohnnyAkzam,,i wasn't sure when i was going to openly discuss this thru my campaign  but now is as good a time as any to say # metoo. women are not alone.
JohnnyAkzam,,you keep missing a big mark here. while i know it is more prevalent for women  # metoo applies to men too.

madiarsg,,i cannot have anyone standing behind me. they have to be in my sight. no sneaking up on me. touching can almost be physically painful # metoo
madiarsg,,but that didn't mean he wasn't going to attack another girl. and he did hurt me  just not in the way i understood back then. # metoo
madiarsg,,i didn't think of others. i only thought  he didn't really do anything to me  just tried to. # metoo
madiarsg,,should i have spoken up? absolutely. could i have spoken up? yes. but i was a scared  naive 19 year old girl working in a warehouse. # metoo
madiarsg,,it wasn't until my 30's i finally understood. he would have done that anyway. he was a predator. he didn't like the word no. # metoo
madiarsg,,but i was 19. for years i thought that it was my fault. i led him on. i was too slutty. i dressed to provocatively. # metoo
madiarsg,,i was one of the lucky ones. i was able to stop him before anything more than inappropriate touching happened. # metoo
madiarsg,,the shorts i wore for work in that hot warehouse distracted him  he said. # metoo
madiarsg,,i was flirting with him  he said. i was leading him on  he said. because i kissed his friend i had to give him one  he said. # metoo
madiarsg,,every time i told him no  he would come back more forcefully  hands everywhere  trying to kiss me # metoo
madiarsg,,he felt that he could corner me at work  at parties  to attempt to force himself on me # metoo

GioLovesYou,,my recommendation is that # technology companies come up with # severe # penalties for people who are extreme # abusers like @ foulbastard. they should not leave me hanging w/this invader into year 10  they should expose him in the name of justice & fairness. pt 4 of 4 # metootownhall
GioLovesYou,,same anonymous-to-this-day person ( @ foulbastard) # catfished me  # hacked me & still to to this day (almost 10 years later) gets away with it. it devastated my life  caused # trauma. @ apple does nothing. @ twittersafety does nothing. pt 3 of 4 # metootownhall
GioLovesYou,,as a geek  i knew it was possible--skype was just coming out as new technology. @ apple confirmed that it could happen but said they had no division for dealing with it. they did nothing. abuser watched me & others undress. pt 2 of 4 # metootownhall
GioLovesYou,,"when i had an online abuser ( @ foulbastard) spy on me in my home in 2008 via my computer  no one i knew believed it was possible. i was told that it was ""crazy"" that *i* was ""losing it"" by several people. pt 1 of 4 # metootownhall"

GioLovesYou,,the next generation of # men need to be taught that they cannot take their anger or abuse issues out on # women because they feel they have # power over them. they need to understand that they will now be held responsible for their behaviors which inflict harm and pain. # metoo
GioLovesYou,,going to make it my life's mission to expose the true identity of # stalker  # hacker  # catfisher  # abuser  # manipulator @ foulbastard. one way or another  justice will come to me after almost a decade. he's not going to get away w/it  i know someone out there cares. # metoo # fbi
GioLovesYou,,the underlying # problem with all these male online # trolls: they're either # bored or extremely # lonely. # men and # loneliness is a major problem in society that no one is addressing. we need to find healthier ways for them to # cope. # metoo # solution # idea
GioLovesYou,,"if you are a woman and you find yourself with an online # stalker here's the responses: women: ""that's scary!"" men: ""i wish i had a stalker."" those are real responses. men need to realize that having someone anonymously stalk you is *not* desirable. # metoo"
